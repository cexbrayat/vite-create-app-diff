# Vite create-app diff

This repository exposes a Vite app (with Vue and TypeScript) generated with
`npm init @vitejs/app ponyracer --template vue-ts` with each version of `@vitejs/app`.

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/cexbrayat/vite-create-app-diff/compare/1.6.0...1.7.0

See table below for the complete list.

Note that this is inspired by [Angular CLI diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff).

This is a small project that we needed to keep our ebook [Become a ninja with Vue 3](https://books.ninja-squad.com/vue)
and our [online training about Vue 3](https://vue-exercises.ninja-squad.com) up to date,
we hope it can be useful for you too!

## Why this repository ?

After an upgrade of Vite in your project, you'll have to keep the configuration up-to-date, and it can be hard to keep track.

This project lets you easily know what changed.
